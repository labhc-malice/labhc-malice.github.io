**IVP.** The *Initial Value Problem* (IVP) consists in predicting the solution at some spatio-temporal position $$(x,t)$$ given the initial solution at the initial instant $$t=0$$.

**Physics-Informed.** A model is said to be *Physics-Informed* when the differential equation is known and used to train the model.

**Neural-FEM.** The *Neural Finite-Element-Method** is a class of methods where the solution function of the differential equation is parametrized by a neural network. It is mesh-independent and requires the differential equation to be known (see physics-informed). Typical examples are PINNs.

**Method of characteristics.** The *Method of characteristics** is a technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) where the PDE is rewritten as a family of ordinary differential equations.
