**Context:** PINNs may not fit the residual/boundary/initial conditions in "rapidly varying regions" depending on the PDE.

**Proposed solution:** The neural network learns which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, like the one used in computer vision. Each data point is associated with its self-adaptation weight.
- Cons:
	- 3 hyperparameters per training instance + one learning rate
	- Max? A bit heuristic
	- Need to always use the same colocation points


**Proposed solution (SGD):** extension to handle varying colocation points. The basic idea is to use a spatial-temporal predictor of the value of self-adaptive weights for the newly sampled points. Resort to a Gaussian process.


**Other previously proposed solutions:** 
- Non-adaptive Weighting [Colby et al., Computational Physics, 2021]: put premium in the loss for the initial 
- Learning Rate Annealing [Wang et al., 2020]: the weights are learning rate coefficients that change for each epoch according to statistics calculated using the data of the back-propagation
- Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tangent_kernel) Weighting: based on the evolution of the eigenvalues
- Mimimax Weighting: update the weights during training using gradient descent for the network weights, and gradient ascent for the loss weights, seeking 
to find a saddle point in weight space.
