The goal of the MALICE project-team is to combine the interdisciplinary skills present at the Hubert Curien lab in statistical learning and laser-matter interaction to foster the development of new joint methodological contributions at the interface between Machine Learning and Surface Engineering. 

As such, MALICE is inherently rooted at the crossroads of Applied Mathematics, Statistical Learning Theory, Optimization, Physics and Differentiable Simulation.
