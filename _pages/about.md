The goal of the MALICE Inria project-team is to combine the interdisciplinary skills present at the Hubert Curien laboratory in statistical learning and laser-matter interaction to foster the development of new joint methodological contributions at the interface between Machine Learning and Surface Engineering. 

Axis 1: Theoretical frameworks when learning from data and background knowledge<br>
Axis 2: Integration and extraction of knowledge in surface engineering<br>
Axis 3: Domain generalization and transfer learning for surface engineering

As such, MALICE is inherently rooted at the crossroads of Applied Mathematics, Statistical Learning Theory, Optimization, Physics and Differentiable Simulation.
