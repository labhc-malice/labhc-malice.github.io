"Lead by the ENES, the AXA Baby Cry 1000 project aims at recording 1000 babies, each for one day after
they are born to help early diagnosis of cognitive development issues and compare with the development
of premature babies. The project is a joint effort by three labs (ENES, Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Rémi
Emonet), and SAINBIOSE-MoVE, CHU Saint-Étienne) and is funded by the AXA Fundation for a total of
1M€ and a duration of 3 years."
