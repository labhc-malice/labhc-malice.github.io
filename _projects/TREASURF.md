"TREASURF is an interdisciplinary project focusing on the development of novel machine learning
approaches for the prediction of surface functionalization of different families of metals and metal
alloys by (femto)laser irradiation. The ability to predict the micro- or nanopatterns induced by laser
functionalization is a crucial challenge for an optimal use of surface properties. In this context, machine
learningmethods have been subject of a growing interest recently but they have to cope with of limited
amounts of experimental data due to the very high acquisition costs. In the TREASURF project, we
propose to address this problem by developingmethods able to transfer the knowledge of a prediction
model learned from a given metal or alloy to another, different but sharing certain properties. Re-training
a new model is not a plausible hypothesis, mainly because of the difficulties involved in acquiring large
quantities of data (laser irradiation + nanoscale imaging). This project is therefore situated in a difficult
context of "frugal" learning. Our aim is to focus primarily on topographic predictions for two or more
different alloy families. The project also envisages taking into account variability due to chemical changes
to guide the transfer process. The advances made in this project will enable us to better characterize
the impact of laser-matter interaction with the perspective of designing new surface functionalizations
on various novel metal alloys, opening the door to new application prospects in numerous societal
challenges related to health, energy, space, nuclear or defense."
