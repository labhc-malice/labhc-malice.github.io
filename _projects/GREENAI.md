"The project I-Démo Région "GreenAI" involves three key actors working collaboratively towards
sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Dracula Technologies specializes in developing organic
photovoltaic cells that harness ambient light to power IoT devices, aligning with environmental sustainability
goals. ASYGN contributes by designing ultra-low-power hardware accelerators to enable advanced
AI processing directly on IoT devices. The Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Jordan Patracone) focuses on
energy-efficient artificial intelligence for computer vision, optimizing neural network architectures for
low-resource hardware through two scientific theses (among which, that of Ben Gao). This work is
sponsored by a public grant overseen by the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, Grenoble Alpes Métropole,
and BPIFrance."
